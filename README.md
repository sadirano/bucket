# Bucket

This repository is a collection of Scoop manifests for my personal tools.

## Adding the Bucket to Scoop

To add this bucket to your Scoop installation, open PowerShell or CMD and run:

```powershell
scoop bucket add bucket https://github.com/sadirano/bucket
```

## Installing Tools

Once the bucket is added, you can install tools from it. For example, to install the **core** tool, run:

```powershell
scoop install core
```
